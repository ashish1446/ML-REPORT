\section*{Overview}

This is a compilation of what I have learned so far. Itâ€™s not an original work,but a compilation of scribed notes of the ML course by Dr Sanjoy Dasgupta(UCSD) which I audited.Some parts are drawn/inspired from Andrew NG's Stanford CS229 course.My primary reference was 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' by Hastie,Tibshirani,Friedman.So there will be considerable overlap with the aforementioned materials.This note might lack mathematical rigor but I have tried to give proofs and supplementary topics wherever necessary.Please write to me if you find any innaccuracies.I hope this  this proves at least moderately
interesting or useful for you.
